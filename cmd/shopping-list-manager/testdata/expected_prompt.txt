I have list of web search result page titles (one per line), try to guess what is the product name (usually it's a grocery store item, but not always):

```
Tacokastike
Tacokastike 100 g
```

If search results are in multiple languages, prefer Finnish and then English.

This will be variable *ProductName*. It may or may not be in Finnish.

I want also to resolve product type (*ProductType*) and product category (*ProductCategory*) for the product name. Product type example is just "Milk" and product category is one of these rigid options:

- Other
- Produce (Fruits & Vegetables)
- Meat & Seafood
- Deli
- Dairy & Eggs
- Bakery / Bread
- Pantry / Dry Goods
- Canned & Jarred
- Baking Supplies
- Breakfast (cereal, oatmeal, spreads)
- Snacks
- Beverages
- Frozen Foods
- Condiments & Sauces
- Spices & Seasonings
- Household / Cleaning
- Paper Goods (toilet paper, napkins, towels)
- Personal Care / Health
- Baby
- Pet
- Alcohol (where applicable)

Please respond succinctly in this format:

```
Product name: <ProductName>
Product type: <ProductType>
Product category: <ProductCategory>
Notes: <notes if you have any additional notes, for example if you're unsure of some detail>
```

For the category if you're unsure choose "Other" and include in notes why you're unsure.
